                             ##   MY SELF
Good morning, firstly, I thank you for giving me the golden opportunity to introduce myself.  

My name is CH.Charankumar born and bought up in vizayanagaram.  

I've pursued my bachelor's degree in computer applications from GITAM College Vishakhapatanam.  

In my firstl year, I started studying computer science through my College, in a result of not getting 
  placed for the first 3 to 4 companies I started improving my skills and I got my certificate from  
   Google in the Digital Marketing domain and Cloud computing.  

Rather than doing courses related to my degree, I found my interests and passion in the courses I've been   certified with all my dedication and passion I will give my cent per cent commitment and would   work smart towards the utilisation   

Thank you once again.
